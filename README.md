# Pokedex 
## Idea

Growing up, one of my first games was Pokémon. I played it on my GameBoy and have really great memories of it. Just recently, I came across the [PokèAPI](https://pokeapi.co/). Using this and NextJS I created a simple Pokedex for the original 160 Pokémon of the Red, Green, and Yellow versions. 

## Libraries

- axios
- NextJS
- The styling is done in plain CSS

## Usage

    alt='Home screenshot'
    style='float: left; margin-right: auto;'
/>
